## Downloaded at install time (native Raspberry Pi installs, optional)

When you turn on **HTTPS**, the installer downloads a prebuilt [lego](https://github.com/go-acme/lego)
binary (MIT licence) from its GitHub releases to get and renew the certificate. It is not distributed
with MeshCore Home; the version and SHA-256 checksums are pinned in `deploy/native/lego.lock`.

When you set up the **radio HAT**, the installer downloads a prebuilt
[ZephCore](https://github.com/liquidraver/ZephCore) binary (MIT licence; it includes Monocypher,
BSD-2-Clause OR CC0-1.0, and is built on Zephyr RTOS, Apache-2.0) from its GitHub releases. It is
not distributed with MeshCore Home; the exact version and SHA-256 checksums are pinned in
`deploy/native/zephcore.lock`.
